A sample Flutter app with Google Maps.
This example follows [Kenzie Schmoll](https://medium.com/@kenzieschmoll)'s article: [Adding Google Maps to Flutter](https://medium.com/flutter-io/google-maps-and-flutter-cfb330f9a245) on medium.com. Additional reference: [Exploring Google Maps in Flutter](https://medium.com/flutter-community/exploring-google-maps-in-flutter-8a86d3783d24) by [Deven Joshi](https://medium.com/@dev.n) 

A basic app would look like:

#### More ...
Once again, the GoogleMap widget is just a widget. This means you can place widgets on top of it, you can place it inside other widgets (like a ListView, for example), or if youâ€™re feeling a bit wild, you could even place it in a Transform widget.
